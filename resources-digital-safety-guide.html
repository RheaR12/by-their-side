            These tips are for people who are worried that someone else might check their phone or computer.
            They’re not perfect, but they can make it a little bit harder for someone to see that you visited
            <em>by their side</em> or other support sites.
          </p>
          <div class="warning-box" style="margin-top:0.9rem;">
            If the person you’re worried about has access to your passwords, regularly checks your devices, or
            uses monitoring apps, it may be difficult or unsafe to fully hide what you’re doing online. Your
            safety comes first.

            <h3>1. Use a private or “incognito” window if possible</h3>
            <p>
              Many browsers have a mode that doesn’t save history in the same way as normal windows. The name
              looks a bit different depending on what you use:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> “New Incognito window”</li>
              <li><strong>Safari (Mac/iPhone):</strong> “Private Browsing”</li>
              <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> “New Private Window”</li>
              <li><strong>Edge:</strong> “InPrivate window”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you can, open this site in one of those windows. When you’re done, close the whole window, not
              just the tab.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="page-section">
            <h3>2. Clear this site from your recent history</h3>
            <p>
              If you didn’t use private mode, you may still be able to remove this page from your history. This
              is different on every device, but usually:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open your browser’s history (often under a menu called “History” or the clock icon).</li>
              <li>Look for a list of sites you’ve visited.</li>
              <li>If you see our website’s name or link, choose “Remove”, “Delete”, or “Clear”.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Be careful: if you normally have a long history and suddenly delete everything, that might look
              unusual to someone who checks your device a lot. Deleting only a few items can draw less attention.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="page-section">
            <h3>3. Close tabs and apps when you’re done</h3>
            <p>
              After you finish reading, close this tab and any other tabs that might show related searches. On a
              phone, also close the browser from your list of open apps so it doesn’t pop up when someone taps
              “recent apps”.

          <section class="page-section">
            <h3>4. Consider using a safer device if you can</h3>
            <p>
              If it doesn’t feel safe to use your own phone or laptop, it might be safer to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a friend’s device that the person doesn’t have access to</li>
              <li>Use a school or library computer (and log out afterwards)</li>
              <li>Access information through a trusted adult who can hold it for you</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="page-section">
            <h3>5. Save information in low-risk ways</h3>
            <p>
              If you’re worried someone might see screenshots or notes on your device, you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Remember just the phrase <em>“by their side”</em> and search for us later when it’s safer.</li>
              <li>Write down a phone number or website and give it to a trusted friend to keep.</li>
              <li>Bookmark this page only if you’re sure no one checks your bookmarks.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="page-section">
            <h3>6. If you feel unsafe right now</h3>
            <p>
              If reading this page has helped you realize that you might be in danger, you can consider reaching
              out to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Assaulted Women’s Helpline (Ontario):</strong> 1-866-863-0511
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Kids Help Phone (Canada):</strong> 1-800-668-6868 or text CONNECT to 686868
              </li>
              <li>
                A local shelter or crisis line in Peel Region
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You’re also allowed to simply sit with this information for now. Noticing that something doesn’t
              feel right is already an important step.
