          <em>by their side</em> grew out of quiet conversations with Indo-Caribbean and South Asian youth in Peel
          who were trying to make sense of love, family, and safety. This project is one way of honouring those
          stories and refusing to leave people alone with their questions.

          <h3>Listening before planning</h3>
          <p>
            Before there were workshops, slides, or handouts, there were young people sharing what they were
            carrying: feeling watched, feeling guilty, feeling responsible for other people’s moods, and feeling
            unsure if what they were experiencing “counted” as harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            We listened in classrooms, during office hours, on walks home, at community events, and in between
            meetings. Many of the stories sounded different on the surface, but they held the same questions:
            <em>“Is this normal?”</em>, <em>“Do I deserve better?”</em>, <em>“What will my family say?”</em>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="page-section">
          <h3>Rooted in Indo-Caribbean & South Asian community</h3>
          <p>
            Peel holds so many migration stories, aunties’ warnings, WhatsApp forwards, and unspoken family
            histories. It also holds joy, faith, and deep care. <em>by their side</em> does not ask anyone to leave
            their culture at the door; it asks what becomes possible when we talk honestly about the parts of our
            stories that make harm easier to hide.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="page-section">
          <h3>Prevention as everyday practice</h3>
          <p>
            We are not a crisis line or a one-time assembly. Our work is about the little moments: a question a
            teacher decides to ask, a friend choosing to listen instead of tease, a parent trying a different
            sentence than the one they heard growing up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every workshop is an experiment in doing prevention differently — more grounded in community, more
            honest about power, and more gentle with the people in the room.
