        <p class="page-intro">
          Coercive control is when someone slowly takes over your choices, time, and freedom while still
          calling it love. It can feel confusing, because it doesn’t always look like yelling or hitting —
          sometimes it sounds like “I’m just worried about you.”
        </p>
      </header>

      <div class="page-content">
        <section class="page-section">
          <h3>What coercive control can feel like</h3>
          <p>
            Coercive control often shows up in small, repeated actions that leave you feeling smaller over time.
            You might notice that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You feel nervous about how they will react to what you wear, who you talk to, or where you go.</li>
            <li>You find yourself changing your behaviour to avoid them getting upset.</li>
            <li>They say they’re the only one who really understands you, and everyone else is against you.</li>
            <li>You feel guilty for wanting time alone, or for spending time with friends and family.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="page-section">
          <h3>Controlling what you wear</h3>
          <p>
            Clothing is a common way control shows up. It might sound like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“I don’t like it when other people look at you.”</li>
            <li>“If you dress like that, you’re asking for attention.”</li>
            <li>“Change, or I’m not going out with you.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In many of our communities, clothing is already tied to culture, religion, and “what people will say.”
            That makes it easy for someone to use those ideas to control you: saying they’re just “protecting your
            reputation” or “keeping the family name safe.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wanting to dress in a way that feels like you — while still being connected to your culture and faith —
            is not something to be ashamed of. You deserve to feel like your clothes are a choice, not a battlefield.
          </p>

        <section class="page-section">
          <h3>When control is disguised as care</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes control hides inside sentences that sound caring:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Text me when you get home so I know you’re safe.” (becomes “Why didn’t you text back in 2 minutes?”)</li>
            <li>“I just don’t trust your friends.” (becomes “You’re not allowed to see them anymore.”)</li>
            <li>“Wear something more modest.” (becomes “I decide what you wear.”)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You are allowed to ask yourself: <em>“If this is care, why do I feel smaller?”</em>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="page-section">
          <h3>Checking in with yourself</h3>
          <p>Here are a few gentle questions you can sit with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do I feel like I have to hide parts of myself to keep this relationship calm?</li>
            <li>Is it getting easier or harder to talk to my friends and family?</li>
            <li>When I imagine saying “no” to them, what do I feel in my body?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If these questions bring up a lot, you don’t have to figure it out alone. You can share this page with a
            trusted friend, elder, teacher, or counsellor and talk about it together.
          </p>

        <section class="page-section">
          <h3>If you’re worried about someone else</h3>
          <p>
            If you notice a friend’s partner constantly commenting on their clothes, checking their phone, or getting
            angry when they spend time with you, it might be a sign of coercive control. You don’t have to have the
            perfect words. Simply saying:
          </p>
          <p><em>“I’ve noticed a few things that worry me. If you ever want to talk, I’m here.”</em></p>
          <p>can be a powerful start.</p>
